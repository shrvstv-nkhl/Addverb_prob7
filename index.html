                NEW TRAVEL PROTOCOL FOR PASSENGERS TO ENSURES COVID FREE PUBLIC TRANPORT PREMISES
            </div>
            <div class="sub-headline">
                Can COVID-19 spread through public transport systems? It is difficult to answer this question with numbers. A recent paper from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology argued that New York’s subways seeded the epidemic in the city. While the research fails to establish causation from the observed correlation, as the author had admitted, it cannot be discarded as implausible. It is commendable that India shut down public transport before it could contribute to the spread, with an early lockdown. We now need to consider what can ensue on a restart, especially of metro rail/buses.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Passengers will sit on alternate seats in the train or stand, maintaining a gap of one meter. Suitable marking on the seats have been made.
            </li>
            <li>
                The dwell time of trains will be substantially increased so that passengers have sufficient time to board and alight. This will avoid pushing by passengers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Passengers are advised to use Áarogya Setu App.
            </li>

            <li>
                Thermal screening to all the passengers will be done at the frisking points.
            </li>

            <li>
                Mask will be mandatory for all passengers.
            </li>

            <li>
                Tokens will not be permitted for travelling, only smart cards will be allowed.
            </li>
            <li>
                All transactions for recharge of cards, etc will be through cashless modes, tokens will not be allowed for travel, only smart card/QR code will be allowed, ticket vending machine will not accept cash.
            </li>
            <li>
                Actions are needed from both authorities and the public to keep our public transport systems safe. If no such actions are taken and a serious level of viral transmission is later traced to public transit, the result will be a mode shift to private vehicles. As pollution and accidents kill more people in India than COVID-19 does now, a mode shift away from public transport will have long-term consequences. Our buses and trains must be perceived as safe, so it is vital to assure ourselves that public transport is for the public – not the virus.

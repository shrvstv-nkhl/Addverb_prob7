                COVID-19 has devastated Thailand's tourism, and recovery is still uncertain

                The number of tourist arrivals around the world has dropped 56% per cent according to the World Tourism
                Organization (UNWTO), after international travel almost vanished because of the Coronavirus pandemic.
                This is part of the 2020 economic loss that is three times that of the global economic crisis that began
                in 2007. A country which has necessarily been affected by this calamity is Thailand, where the tourism
                industry is one of the most important sectors of the economy. Businesses and people in this industry are
                suffering.
